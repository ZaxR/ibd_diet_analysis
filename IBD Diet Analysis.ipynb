    "This post is the second in a three-part series describing my attempt to identify “safe” and “unsafe” foods for Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD; including Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease) using various machine learning techniques and Python. Part II below walks through the methodologies of the study, as well as selections of code. The working project is available at https://github.com/ZaxR/ibd_diet_analysis and a [reliable] working view of the jupyter notebook is available via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zaxr/ibd_diet_analysis/blob/master/IBD%20Diet%20Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap and expand upon the questions this analysis is trying to answer (from Part I):\n",
    "* Are there any identifiable sub-clusters of diet among the survey participants?\n",
    "* Are there relationships between individual foods or groups of foods? If so, can we\n",
    "   * find common nutrient links between those foods? or\n",
    "   * use that information to reduce the dimensionality of our features and improve our ability to predict food tolerance/intolerance?\n",
    "* Are there any nutrients, vitamins, or minerals that impact food tolerance?\n",
    "* Can food tolerance/intolerance be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy (ideally probability) for an IDB sufferer with only a few “known” safe/unsafe foods?"

    "### Materials: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The data reflects 670 survey responses from IBD sufferers (collected by [IBDrelief.com](https://www.ibdrelief.com/ \"IBDrelief.com\")) where they were asked for each of 250 foods to answer how well he/she tolerated the food. The [online] survey utilizes a sliding scale to accept answer inputs (see the survey [here](https://www.ibdrelief.com/surveys/diet \"Diet Survey\")), which are stored as integer values in a range from 0 through 10. A checkbox for each question gives the participant the option to not answer questions individually. The survey was developed and data has been provided by ibdrelief.com.\n",
    "* Nutrient information for each surveyed food from the USDA’s database (provided for free via their API).\n",
    "* Python 3.6.1, with apyori, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, and sqlite libraries for data analysis and jupyter notebook, matplotlib, and seaborn for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given that the analysis is beginning from survey data about well/not-so-well tolerated foods, our implicit assumption is that food impacts symptoms of IBD. However, as discussed in part I, research has found no foods that are specifically linked to IBD symptoms to-date; and the role of food generally in causing and/or triggering flares of IBD is poorly understood. That said, given anecdotal evidence and the strong belief in food-based symptom management by IBD patients, the results of this analysis remain relevant.\n",
    "* That said, the quality of the survey data also has caveats, given that data (survey responses) is provided on a [self-reported basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-report_study “Wikipedia link”) (e.g. participants’ responses are based on the limited knowledge/not knowing what they can/can’t eat and to what degree); potentially has other survey-design-based biases (e.g. [response biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias “Wikipedia link”) such as [extreme responding bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias#Extreme_responding “Wikipedia link”) and [sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias “Wikipedia link”)); and is subject to a number of other potential [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases “Wikipedia link”) (e.g. [illusory truth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect “Wikipedia link”)).\n",
    "* Lastly, the data set itself is very limited, with at most 570 usable surveys, only 19 of which are complete for all 250 foods (details in the data munging section below)."

    "So the remaining data points seem to accurately reflect our usable data set, but now the quality/usability of that data is called into doubt. Before we clean up the data further (decide how to handle NaNs), we need to assess what type of data we're working with (measurement scale), and as a result, the available/appropriate tests we'll be using the data for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining whether our survey results most appropriately reflect interval data (as it was collected) or [discrete] ordinal data (categorical data, where the values don't necessarily have equal \"distance\") is somewhat challenging in this case, and extremely important.  If we determine that our data is ordinal, parameters such as mean and standard deviation will likely be invalid, and any parametric analyses (generally considered to have more statistical power) based on the normal distribution will be impossible. Rather, rank, median, and range and associated tests (such as classification) will be the extent of our toolkit. The “intervalness” of the data is an attribute of the data, not of the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary distinguishing factor will be whether the \"distance\" between responses is equal and meaningful. The edge cases in specific will be the determining factor: is the distance between 0 and 1 (never eat and very, very rarely eat) the same as 1 to 2 (very, very rarely eat to very rarely eat)? Unfortunately it seems logical that those distances are not the same (although survey partcipants may have mentally been assuming such equal increments in attempting to place the scale). You can eat \"infinitely\" more of a food at 1 than 0 (i.e. how can you even measure the distance from always to anything less than always?), bounded only by the normal quantities of food people can/want to eat. As a result of the fact that distances are inherently unequal, it would seem that the data should be treated as ordinal (and for testing purposes, therefore, largely categorical).\n",
    "\n",
    "However the answer to this question is actually highly controvetial in the field of statistics, with Likert survey results (usually five or seven options, presented as variations on 'Always,' 'Sometimes,' 'Never') being the primary focus of that debate/research. The scope of the debate is beyond the pervue of this report, but the ultimate \"answer\" to the debate is that in at least some cases (particularly when we have data collected from a label-less, continuous, sliding scale, as with our survey data; see sample image below), interval-type parametric analysis is robust enough with respect to violations of its core assumptions that it can appropriately be run on Likert-style survey data. As a result, we will cautiously attempt to analyze the data assuming interval measurement in some cases (understanding the limitations of mean and variance as descriptive statistics).\n",

    "That said, and even assuming we have interval data, the facts that 1) the data was collected on a integer basis (as opposed to continuous) and 2) the probability distibutions of each of the food's responses are non-normal (and not normalizable without material and potentially biasing transformations) potentially severely limit the ability to utilize the more statistically powerful tests we'd hoped to be able to use anyway (e.g. regressions).

    "Very few clusters were identified in any of the pairwise combinations of foods with any real confidence, and the few that were identified (above) are for the foods with the least responses that are likely the rarest eaten - and where data is sparsest and potentially least reliable.  Additionally, the foods with clusters are not features in our more concentrated datasets that we'll be able to use for our later questions. Viewing the scatterplots of pairwise relationships, it becomes clear that answers are too heterogeneous to reasonably determine any kind of unique clusters in most cases. While our data can't say difinitely that there are no clusters in many of the pairs, it seems improbably, and certainly won't be identifiable in our dataset."
